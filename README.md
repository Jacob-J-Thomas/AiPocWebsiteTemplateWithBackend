ASP.NET React Template
======================

A simple starter template for building React applications powered by the Intelligence Hub API. This project is used as the starting point for a wide variety of the applications I host under the Applied AI name. For additional details on the code behind each of those projects, please reach out to me directly at JacobJonThomas@gmail.com or jacob.thomas@applied-ai-org.com.

Prerequisites
-------------

*   [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
    
*   [Node.js 16+](https://nodejs.org/)
    
*   A URL where an instance of the Intelligence Hub API is running (See https://github.com/appliedai-org/intelligencehub for additional information)
